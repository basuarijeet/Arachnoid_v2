Honestly, idek how I feel about what I am doing in life.. sometimes i just feel-lost. Then there are times I feel like what is wrong with me? Why am I not enough? Why am the one always having to compromise? 
Truthfully speaking, I just want to be prioritized in someone’s life and mean something to them in such a deep level as me. I know that is something that is too much to ask for right now, but I just really hope that I get to experience that someday.. I am shattered from the very root of my existence. My heart is just in a trillion pieces right now, and idek how to express myself or share there as there is nobody to listen to and I dont want to burden anyone, let alone you out of all people with my emotions. You are not responsible for my emotions and I know that. This sucks beyond measure and I do not know for how much longer will I be able to hold out before I break..

Never ever jump to conclusions 
Ask whatever it is, first.
Have a respectful way of conversation and or confrontation if any.

Before anything, her friendship means the world to me and I will never do anything to sabotage that.

You were leaving me….


I would like to know if you are self aware of the decision you are taking to be with me. The reason I am asking this is given the timing of your breakup, I want to clarify if you have genuine feelings for me, or am I a temporary distraction and would like to know where you are emotionally at this point. I however want you to take your time, heal - in the meantime I will be there every step of the way and we get to know each other better and get more comfortable with one another if that’s okay.
And I do love the old school way. I will ask you out formally on dates, and I will propose to you when you are ready and I am ready. I do not want to rush into things because I know it will take us time to figure things out and get ready for a relationship. 

I want to be your best friend before being your boyfriend or partner. And I would like for you to feel free to share anything and everything with me. Even if you feel that I wont like hearing it. Without the fear of how I will react to it. 

Thank you for the reassurance. Its just that I dont want to feel that burden to meet certain lifestyle expectations. Not that we will not live the lifestyle we want, we will do better than what we expect. Its just that its an unhealthy and unnecessary pressure that makes life harder to always have the thought of oh i need to make so much money or need to purchase that thing and so on..hope my concern makes sense


1. What do you think about the dealbreakers for me? And I would like to know the dealbreakers for you as well
2. Does my past concern you? Do you accept me with my past and do you think it will be a problem or a cause of concern for you in the future? Do you think you will ever bring it up during misunderstandings or arguments? Or justify my actions because of my past or pity me in any way for all that I revealed to you?

I dont want us to feel burdened by the thought of building a future, marriage and life. Instead i would like us to stay grounded and in the present and have fun, do the best we can right now and just go with the flow..there is no point worrying about the future.




Hmmm

Yeah so im so madly in love with this girl and i just cant get her out of my head

But alas, she can never me mine.
We were never meant to be.
Shes a butterfly soaring in the sky
And im just a little snail looking up
And wondering why ill never be able to fly.

It sucks! The glance of her face brings back all those suppressed feelings and memories rushing back like a gigantic wave of a tsunami…
But the fact is, i need to get better.
A hundred times better than i current am!
But maybe even then, shed be way out of my league..
Its true. And it hurts, but it is of my own doing which i must suffer.

Im disgusted at myself. Then how can i expect someone to look at me the way i dont look at my own self….
I need to get better.!.!

Im so damn pretentious 
Pretend to be busy, pretend to be studying, pretend to be knowing.
All i know is pretending and thats another reason why im disgusted at myself.

Quite ambitious of me to think that a girl would like me. A person like me!!!
God forbid anybody should like me at this stage! It will not end well for them for sure


Plan going ahead after bba.

Have a standing offer by the time i graduate.
Try applying for jobs abroad.
Work for required no of years to be eligible for executive mba.
Prepare for gmat
